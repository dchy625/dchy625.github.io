  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this analysis is to increase awareness and provide information about the danger of 
  head injuries in sports. In youth sports male high school football players sustain the highest number of concussions, 
  followed by female soccer players. In professional sports, men playing American football sustain 
  the highest number of concussions. </p>
  <p>The NFL released data showing that concussion rates ave declined in recent years, with a greater 
  focus on prevention of concussions and stricter penalties enforced and NFL fines for players. In 2015, approximately 
  271 concussion occurred during the NFL preseason and regular season. Increased focus on head injuries and
  better health education may account for the recent decline in concussions. In general, teens between the ages of 
  14-16 years old are most at risk because their brains are not fully developed and more prone to injury.
  
  In this analysis, we looked at some NFL player data and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy data, which is believed 
  to be caused by repeated head injuries in athletes. Awareness about the links between head injuries and 
  long term degenerative brain illness, such as CTE, is important and researchers such as Dr Ann McKee (who authored 
  the paper where our CTE data came from) are crucial in bringing this issue to the forefront of healthcare.
