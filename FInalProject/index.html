  <h2>Hello NFL fans!</h2>
  <p>Some background on this analysis: The National Football League (NFL) is a professional football league in the United States consisting of 32 city teams. The NFL has become controversial in recent years with a high number of concussions and retired players exhibiting symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is a neurodegenerative disease thought to be caused by brain injuries. The average life expectancy of individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of CTE is 51 years. A confirmation of diagnosis can only occur upon autopsy, so many may be struggling with the symptoms of the disease without knowing their diagnosis. A New York Times article notes a study done by a neuropathologist who examined the deceased brains of 111 NFL players and found that 110 had a confirmed diagnosis of CTE. This report will discuss some general NFL player statistics and delve into some data on CTE in athletes. We will try to draw some broad conclusions from the results, but there is a significant lack of research and data on head injuries in athletes. Much more work needs to be done to tackle this pressing issue.
